# EEGMorseProgram
The program allows the user to print words with the morse code pattern using blinks. A blink with the left eye is a dash and a blink with the right eye is a dot

In order for the game to work you will have to go to install specific node modules

npm init -y

npm install --save muse-js

npm install --save systemjs

Then Live server will need to be added

npm install -g live-server
